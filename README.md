MISC

This is a WIP emulator for a fictional CPU architecture I'm calling the Minimal Instruction Set Computer. It is meant to be a simple and easily comprehensible 8-bit machine somewhere between the CHIP-8 and the 6502.

It maxes out at a meager 32 instructions (currently 28 opcodes in use) and a mere 8 addressing modes with a 16-bit address space and 4 (X, Y, Z, W) general purpose registers.

More docs to come.
